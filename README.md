2/12/2018 - UPDATE

I am updating this in the hopes that you will have a chance to re-evaluate my work for these exercises.  My original attempt failed in two major ways.  For the first exercise, I realize that I failed to use Page Object Design Pattern.  I wanted to redo this and show my understanding of test/code structure and design meant for easier updating and reusablility.

I also wish I had spent more time on the WhiteBox Testing Exercise.  After a second look, I realize that this is something that I could have made a much better attempt at completing.

Thank you very much for your time and attention.
