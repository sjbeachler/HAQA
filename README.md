# HAQA

First off, let me thank you again for the opportunity to attempt these tasks.  Although they were outside my area of technical expertise, I enjoyed the challenge and the exposure to new things.  I hope you find that my responses show an ability to take multiple technologies with which I have never worked (selenium, github, data.gov, json) on top of other tools with which I have very limited experience (eclipese, java) and deliver logical, working solutions in a relatively short amount of time.  

I developed in Windows 7 with Eclipse, JavaSE-1.7, selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0, json-20160212.
