What are the three bugs?
- canReceiveMessage() assumes that if the current user does not have permission to modify the message recipients, then they can receive messages by returning true by default.

- addRecipientToAllMessages() checks if successfulMessages is empty and should not.  If it is empty, then there will not be a reason to call addRecipient.

- The call to addRecipient sends the currentUser instead of the recipient.


Why doesn't the test find them?
- The test does not find these bugs because the currentUser == recipient and because it is only checking the failed list and not creating/validating a good list.


Tests that would have caught the bugs:

- New automated test expecting a failedList entry made.  Setup a distinct current user and recipient where currentuser.setHasPermissionToModifyRecipients(false).

- Run original test and manually verify good messages recipient list.  The good message should have current user in recipient list (it will not and the bug will be found).

- New automated test.  Setup a distinct current user and recipient where currentuser.setHasPermissionToModifyRecipients(true).  Manually verify the recipient is in the recipient list (it will not be but the current user will be and the bug will be found).
